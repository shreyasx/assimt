# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a visually appealing, fully responsive Next.js dashboard using Tailwind CSS and Material UI (MUI). The dashboard will demonstrate production-ready development skills including clean code structure, accessibility, and modern UI/UX patterns. The application will serve as a comprehensive example of a modern web dashboard with authentication, data visualization, and interactive components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a login page with email and password fields, so that I can authenticate into the dashboard system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root path ("/") THEN the system SHALL display a login page with email and password input fields
2. WHEN the login page is displayed THEN the system SHALL use Material UI components for all form elements
3. WHEN the login page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain pixel-perfect responsive design
4. WHEN a user interacts with form fields THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus states and validation feedback
5. WHEN a user submits the login form THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard (UI only, no actual authentication)

### Requirement 2: Dashboard Layout and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through different sections of the dashboard using a responsive sidebar, so that I can access various features efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with navigation links to Dashboard, Reports, Chat, and Settings
2. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL include appropriate icons for each navigation item using @mui/icons-material
3. WHEN viewed on desktop (md+ breakpoint) THEN the system SHALL show a collapsible sidebar
4. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display an off-canvas drawer for navigation
5. WHEN a user is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the active route in the navigation
6. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a welcome header with "Welcome, John!" or similar dummy name

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Statistics Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see key statistics displayed in cards on the dashboard, so that I can quickly understand important metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard page loads THEN the system SHALL display at least 3 statistics cards
2. WHEN statistics cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL show metrics like "Total Users", "Active Users", and "Total Orders"
3. WHEN each stats card is rendered THEN the system SHALL include appropriate Material UI icons
4. WHEN stats cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement optional animated count-ups for visual appeal
5. WHEN the page is loading THEN the system SHALL show graceful loading skeletons for stats cards

### Requirement 4: Users Data Table

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and interact with a data table of users, so that I can search, sort, and paginate through user information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch user data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
2. WHEN the users table is displayed THEN the system SHALL show columns for Name, Email, Phone, and Company Name
3. WHEN a user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter results client-side with 250ms debouncing
4. WHEN the table has multiple pages THEN the system SHALL provide pagination controls with options for 10, 25, or 50 items per page
5. WHEN a user clicks column headers THEN the system SHALL sort data by Name and Company Name at minimum
6. WHEN the table is displayed THEN the system SHALL be keyboard navigable with sticky header
7. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show optimistic UI with loading states
8. WHEN the table is viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design

### Requirement 5: Reports and Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view charts and analytics with date filtering capabilities, so that I can analyze trends and metrics over specific time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reports page loads THEN the system SHALL display at least one Line or Bar chart showing daily/weekly/monthly trends
2. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL optionally include Pie or Doughnut charts for additional data visualization
3. WHEN a user selects a date range THEN the system SHALL provide From-To date filter controls
4. WHEN date filters are applied THEN the system SHALL recompute chart data and show metric progression for the selected window
5. WHEN chart data changes THEN the system SHALL display derived metrics like totals within range and percentage change vs previous period
6. WHEN the reports page loads THEN the system SHALL use Chart.js or Recharts for chart rendering
7. WHEN charts are displayed THEN the system SHALL organize chart containers with tabs for Daily/Weekly/Monthly views

### Requirement 6: Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a basic chat interface, so that I can view and send messages in a conversational format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat page loads THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with message list, input field, and send button
2. WHEN the chat interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL use either an open-source chat UI library or custom minimal chat components
3. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show dummy users and messages for demonstration
4. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL provide a functional input field with send button
5. WHEN the Enter key is pressed THEN the system SHALL trigger message sending (keyboard shortcut)
6. WHEN the chat has many messages THEN the system SHALL optionally implement virtualized scrolling for performance
7. WHEN the chat loads THEN the system SHALL optionally display a left user list panel

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with different devices and accessibility needs, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly across all screen sizes and assistive technologies, so that I can access all features regardless of my device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on any device THEN the system SHALL implement mobile-first responsive design
2. WHEN interactive elements are focused THEN the system SHALL provide visible focus indicators
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL include proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
4. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
5. WHEN colors are displayed THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
6. WHEN animations occur THEN the system SHALL keep motion under 200ms for frequent interactions
7. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL optionally support dark mode with theme persistence in localStorage

### Requirement 8: Technical Implementation Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow modern development practices, so that the application is maintainable, performant, and production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL use Next.js with App Router and TypeScript in strict mode
2. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS configured to work with MUI emotion/styled engine
3. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL implement clean, reusable component architecture
4. WHEN imports are used THEN the system SHALL configure absolute imports via tsconfig.json paths
5. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
6. WHEN components are tested THEN the system SHALL include component tests for core UI functionality
